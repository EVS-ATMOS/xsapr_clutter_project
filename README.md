# xsapr_clutter_project

A project analyzing clutter from an X-Band radar in Oklahoma.

Code defines clutter based on a threshold value and a calculation of
the standard deviation, mean and variance. There is also a circle radius
function that allows for gates surrounding a clutter gate to also be marked
as clutter depending on the radius integer.

Currently checking other fields and components to see if they can be used
to determine if a gate it clutter or not.
